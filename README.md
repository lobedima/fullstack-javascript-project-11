### Description
RSS is a specialized format designed to describe news feeds, article announcements, and other materials. This is the easiest way for websites (usually blogs) to enable users to subscribe to changes. Special services called RSS aggregators are used for this purpose. These services are able to poll the RSS feeds of websites for new posts and show them in a convenient way, noting what they read and so on.
